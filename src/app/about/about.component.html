        <h3>I am a digital advocate with a passion for building beautiful, responsive web products.</h3>
        <p>
          Currently I program responsive web applications for
          <a href="https://www.cardinalsolutions.com" target="_blank">Cardinal Solutions Group</a>, an IT consulting company. Solving unique problems, collaborating with others, and
          growing from the outcome of my work, are all reasons why I love doing what I do.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time I enjoy creative hobbies (like drawing) and being a community service leader. Since 2015, I have been the
          Charlotte Chapter Leader of
          <a href="https://www.girldevelopit.com" target="_blank">Girl Develop It</a> - a non-profit dedicated to providing affordable, judgment-free opportunities for women interested
          in software engineering. Come be apart of our
          <a href="https://www.meetup.com/gdi-clt" target="_blank">community</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Come June, I will also spend my free time as a teaching assistant for UNC Charlotte's
          <a href="https://bootcamp.uncc.edu/coding/">Full Stack Developer Boot Camp</a>. This six month program will cover the basics from HTML, JavaScript, Node.js,
          and more. If you're curious about this program, or coding boot camps in general, please
          <a href="#services" [ngx-scroll-to]="'#services'">reach out to me</a> to see if it's the right fit for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite web development being such a fundamental skill behind everything we do online, it is also a wonderful viewpoint from
          which to see the world - and I aim to make that accessible for others.
